### Analysis Summary

# CvAnalyser Project Architecture

The `CvAnalyser` project appears to be designed for processing and analyzing CV (Curriculum Vitae) documents. Its architecture can be broadly divided into a main application entry point and a dedicated module for CV analysis, likely leveraging machine learning models.

## High-Level Architecture

The system's primary function is to take CV files as input, process them, and generate some form of analysis or output. The main application orchestrates the file handling and potentially interacts with the core analysis module.

### **Main Application**

*   **Purpose**: Serves as the primary entry point for the `CvAnalyser` system. It likely handles initial setup, file ingestion, and coordination with the CV analysis component.
*   **Internal Parts**:
    *   [Main Application Script](main.py): This file is the likely starting point for the application.
    *   [File Upload Notebook](upload_file.ipynb): This Jupyter Notebook suggests a mechanism for users to upload or input CV files into the system.
*   **External Relationships**:
    *   Interacts with the **CV Analysis Module** to perform the actual analysis of CV documents.
    *   Potentially interacts with external storage or user interfaces for input and output.

### **CV Analysis Module**

*   **Purpose**: This module is responsible for the core logic of CV processing and analysis. It appears to utilize machine learning models, specifically `MiniCPM`, for this task.
*   **Internal Parts**:
    *   [Module Root Directory](file lihgtining/): Contains all the components related to CV analysis.
    *   [Analysis Main Script](file lihgtining/main.py): This could be the entry point for the analysis logic within this module.
    *   [MiniCPM Notebook](file lihgtining/MiniCPM_lightning (1).ipynb): A Jupyter Notebook indicating the use of the `MiniCPM` model, possibly for tasks like information extraction or summarization from CVs.
    *   [Prompt Notebook](file lihgtining/promt.ipynb): Suggests the use of prompts, likely for guiding the `MiniCPM` model or for specific analysis queries.
    *   [Analysis Output Example](file lihgtining/cv_analysis_output_minicpm_o_2_6 (1).txt): An example output file, indicating the type of analysis results generated by the `MiniCPM` model.
    *   [Requirements Files](file lihgtining/requirements_MiniCPM_2_6.txt), [Requirements File](file lihgtining/requirements_MiniCPM_V_2_6.txt): These files list the necessary Python dependencies for the CV analysis module, confirming the use of `MiniCPM`.
*   **External Relationships**:
    *   Receives CV data from the **Main Application**.
    *   Outputs analysis results, potentially back to the **Main Application** or to a designated output location.
