"""
Key Enhancements Made:

1. Improved Security:
   - Path sanitization using pathlib to prevent path traversal attacks
   - Removed use of user-provided full paths; only filenames used in responses
   - Secure extension check with handling for missing/empty extensions

2. Better Error Handling:
   - Replaced JSONResponse with HTTPException (FastAPI best practice)
   - Added detailed error messages including allowed extensions
   - Specific 413 status for payloads exceeding size limits
   - Logging of unexpected errors with full traceback
   - Dedicated 500 status for internal server errors

3. Resource Management:
   - Guaranteed file closure using a `finally` block
   - Safe cleanup of resources even if errors occur

4. Code Quality:
   - Comprehensive docstring describing endpoint functionality
   - Use of constants (e.g., CHUNK_SIZE) for config values
   - Improved filename extraction and naming consistency
   - Meaningful function and variable names (e.g., `upload_file`, `filename`)
   - Use of type hints for all parameters

5. Response Improvements:
   - Success responses include both filename and extension
   - Consistent error response format
   - Byte size limits shown in error messages

6. Validation Enhancements:
   - Proper handling of missing or empty file extensions
   - Explicit `file` parameter enforcement
   - Descriptions added for parameters to appear in Swagger UI

7. Logging:
   - Detailed logging of all handled and unhandled exceptions
   - Dedicated logger instance for better control
   - Clear and meaningful error log messages

8. Performance:
   - Maintains efficient 1MB chunk streaming
   - Early termination when file exceeds allowed size
   - Low memory footprint during uploads

9. API Documentation:
   - Automatic OpenAPI integration via HTTPException
   - Parameter descriptions visible in Swagger UI
   - Detailed endpoint-level docstring

This implementation preserves original functionality while adding production-grade:
- Security
- Reliability
- Maintainability

The endpoint now ensures:
- Clear and actionable error messages
- Secure and consistent filename handling
- Guaranteed resource cleanup
- Informative success responses
- Thorough logging
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation support

⚠️ Reminder: Configure your logging settings in the main FastAPI application for logs to be properly captured.
